# this is where we will write ruby code that will tellour app what to do

# it will take user input and do one of the following:
# do a calculation
# use conditionals to make a comparison
# there will probably also be a method
# add pieces of data together
# pull data from an array, hash, API

# you should be able to TEST THIS MODEL in the terminal using "puts" to get results

# def method(parameter)
    # method does something without puts
# end
# don't put puts in our method

# testing the method (in the terminal):
# puts method
